## Cohort Connect

Micro social network for my coding bootcamp cohort, tracks Github activity and allows users to write encouraging notes

+ React front end shows Github profile synopsis and latest activity to keep classmates connected
+ RESTful Ruby on Rails backend stores and serves short status updates that users can write for themselves or each other
+ Tidy layout utilizes React Semantic UI components to display classmate profiles
+ Calls Github API to retrieve latest commits and share what users are working on
